            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I grew up in Czech republic, when I was 14 years old my family and I visited Canada. At that time I decided I wanted to live here. Determined to make the dream come true I came to Canada for 3 month Working Holiday in my last year of Univeristy program. I found a decent job and I also found the love of my life. Three months turned into four and finally I made a decision to use my existing visa to keep my job and to stay with my girlfriend. After careful consideration I quit school and immigrated to Canada for good.</p>
                <p>I've been working various jobs over the time, but I've always wanted to get back into what I studied at university - IT. When I lost my Heavy Duty Technician position, it motivated me to sign up for TECHCareers - Full Stack Developer course, carried by University of Alberta and get finally get into work that I'm strongly passionate about.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>You may be wondering why I chose this space theme for my resume? I feel this theme fits my personality perfectly. For me it symbolizes adventure, exploration, never stopping, learning and experiencing something new every day, but also my very wild imagination, creativity, thinking outside the usual bounds and looking at problems under wide spectrum of light.</p>
                <p>I've been teaching myself <strong>programming</strong> since 2005 on and off, picking up various languages along the way. Over the years I played with game modding tools and map creators, attempted to create a browser based strategy, learned how to work with Unity and most recently Unreal Engine 4, in which I've created my portfolio game Math Cubed using C++.</p>
                <p>My other hobbies include <strong>Traveling</strong> and especially Road Trips. To mention one of many adventures, in 2018 we drove an old Oldsmobile Woody Wagon 12000 km down to Florida and back. If I have some spare free time I enjoy playing <strong>video games</strong> and I am the happiest, when I get to be <strong>creative</strong>. Which goes along with me doing music since 1998. I started playing piano, picked up guitar and bass in high school and started doing vocals as well. I've been in few bands and was a frontman playing live shows. Now I have a little home studio and I write, compose and record my own music. Below is a song I wrote for my wife for our anniversary. </p>
