                <p>Worked on <em>Insurgency Sandstorm</em> as an <strong>Automation Developer</strong> as part of the <em>Quality Assurance</em> team, contributing to the console release of Sandstorm as well as work on yet unannounced project. My daily tasks consist of <strong>automated test and tool</strong>
                    development, <em>performance and benchmarking</em> tool development and <strong>web application</strong> development related to test and performance reporting. I also participated in <em>playtests</em>,
                    providing feedback based on my player first philosophy. I also provided programming and automation advice and insight to stakeholders and more junior team members.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Most impactful work I did was <em>designing and implementing</em> two level <strong>performance testing modes</strong> for Unreal Engine 4 along with <em>pipelines, database, backend and frontend</em> for test result evaluation and reporting tool.

                <h3>Project Virus</h3>
                <p>A mod for <strong>Insurgency Sandstorm</strong>, which is allowing me to get more practice with <em>Unreal Engine 4</em>, 
                    <strong>Blueprints</strong>, <em>game design</em> as well as <strong>organizational and planning skills</strong>. My friends and I worked on it as a team
                    and we quickly realized how difficult game design is when working only with blueprints, forcing us to outside of the box type of solutions.

                <p>Using combination of <strong>C++</strong> and blueprints within <em>Unreal Engine 4.25</em>, I
                    created a game, which uses math equations and number matching to exercise player's brain in box
                    stacking environment. It was a very valuable experience, especially when it comes to
                    <strong>OOP</strong> and <em>Unreal engine framework</em>. It made me realize how powerful Unreal
                    Engine really is and how easy it is to create a relationship between visual and logic side of
                    project. Code, screenshots and exe is available on my github.

                <p>Created as a capstone full stack project for the TechCareers program, which I recently graduated
                    from. I used <strong>React for front end and C# for back end</strong>. This project was designed out
                    of <em>personal need</em>. It <strong>was really hard to keep track</strong> of all my diet and
                    diabetes related stuff. This app makes it <em>really easy</em> to <strong>keep track and make sense
                        of relevant data</strong>. Inbuilt <em>functions</em> give very quick overview and pull out the
                    data you are looking for. App was designed with <strong>swift and effective performance</strong> in
                    mind.

                <div>
                    <p>I <strong>studied IT</strong> at university in Czech republic, but I decided it was the best
                        option to quit school and immigrate to Canada in 2012. When I lost my Heavy Duty Technician
                        position due to COVID-19 in March 2020, it motivated me to sign up for <em>TECHCareers - Full
                            Stack Developer</em> course, carried by University of Alberta and get finally get back into
                        what I started at University and what I'm <strong>strongly passionate</strong> about.</p>
                    <p>I've been teaching myself <strong>programming since 2005</strong> on and off, picking up various
                        languages along the way. Over the years I played with <strong>game modding tools and map
                            creators,</strong> attempted to create a browser based strategy, learned how to work with
                        Unity and <em>Unreal Engine 4</em>, in which I've created my portfolio game Math
                        Cubed using C++. During my Full Stack Developer course I got deep into <strong>JS, React,
                            Redux and C#</strong>. While working professionally with <em>UE4</em>, I started modding Insurgency Sandstorm and I am in a planning and script writing stage of new story driven project using <strong>UE5</strong>.

                    <p>You may be wondering why I chose this <strong>space theme</strong> for my resume? It
                        <strong>reflects my personality</strong> perfectly. For me it symbolizes adventure, exploration,
                        never stopping, <em>learning and experiencing something new every day</em>, but also my very
                        wild imagination, <strong>creativity</strong>, <em>thinking outside the box</em> and looking at
                        problems under wide spectrum of light.
                    </p>
                    <p>My other hobbies include <strong>Traveling</strong> and especially Road Trips. To mention one of
                        many adventures, in 2018 we drove an old Oldsmobile Woody Wagon 12000 km down to Florida and
                        back. In my free time I enjoy playing <em>video games</em>, and I am the happiest, when I get to
                        be <strong>creative</strong>. Which is one of the reasons why I've been doing <em>music</em>
                        since 1998. I started playing piano, picked up guitar and bass in high school and started doing
                        vocals as well. I've been in few bands and was a front man playing live shows. Now I have a
                        little <strong>home studio</strong> and I write, <em>compose and record</em> my own music. Currently I am
                        also acting as a <strong>Lyricist and Vocalist</strong> in a professional studio project called Shifted Shore, which will be having a release later this year. Below
                        is a song I wrote for my wife for our anniversary. </p>
